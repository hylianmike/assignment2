# FightersStatsNet Java GUI

This is my second assignment project for COMP 1011 using Java.

It is a desktop application that connects to the APIs that I created in ASP.NET, and displays them to the user for them to view. Any information that is entered on the
live site will be displayed in the app upon restarting.

View the Live Site that has the APIs hosted on Azure Web Services <a href="https://fighterstatsnet.azurewebsites.net/">here</a>.
